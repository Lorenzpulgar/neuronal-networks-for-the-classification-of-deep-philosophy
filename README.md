# 🧠 PhiloNet: Neural Classifier for Deep Thought Detection

Ever wondered if a quote is true wisdom or just eloquent nonsense?  
**PhiloNet** is a lightweight neural network built to classify philosophical statements vs. pseudoscientific or vacuous content.

### 🔍 What it does

- Distinguishes philosophical depth from “high-vibration” fluff.
- Trained on curated phrases from real-world examples.
- Useful for NLP experiments, semantic filtering, and satire-aware content moderation.

### 🚀 Quick Start

```python
classify("The quantum field aligns with your soul")  
# → Pseudoscience (confidence: 0.08)

classify("An unexamined life is not worth living")  
# → Philosophy (confidence: 0.91)
